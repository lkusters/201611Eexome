## Synopsis
Experiment where we contstruct the full context trees corresponding to 
the exome and corresponding to the genome. Then we apply the models for 
compression on each separate sequence and store the performance.

## Modules summary
Pmodel.py - parser for constructing the model corresponding to input files
Papply.py - parser for applying given models to input files and storing the results
Pprintrecords.py - parser for testing some basic functions
